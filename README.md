# TV Watch List
## Purpose of this app

This is just a personal practice project. The idea is a customizable organizational app one can utilize to keep track of their TV show episodes and movies. Many streaming services and websites already have a simple watch list feature built into their own app, but it can still become confusing if one utilizes many different services.

The user will be able customize their own category groups of shows or movies and use them as filters along with the built in filters and sorting provided by the app.

The built in filters include sorting by newest episodes/seasons, currently watching, plan to watch later, completed watching, etc.

The app will also be able to build a schedule of newly released episodes for each show on the currently selected list. This app also uses a 3rd party API to provide data on shows the user wants to add to their list or already has added to the list.
